# OnePace X OnePiece Kai Stremio Addon

## Overview

### This project is just a mod of the Orginal addon you  can find here: [OnePace addon](https://github.com/fedew04/OnePaceStremio)

This addon integrates One Piece KAI episodes to fill in missing sections in One Pace, specifically for the Arabasta Arc, Skypiea Arc, and Water 7. Once installed on your Stremio account, the addon will sync across all platforms.

### Important Notes:

- For a complete episode list that includes the Kai episodes, you may need to delete the original OnePace addon.
- Subtitles don't work properly in ExoPlayer, this is especially noticeable in Android variants of Stremio, Go to Settings --> Player --> Switch to LibVLC for a much better experience. You can also "open in VLC" if you are on Desktop
- You can also set Stremio to default to Japanese as the preferred language in Stremio settings if you find the English dub playing as default whilst trying to watch subbed.

## Features

- Added thumbnails for a better visual experience
- Integrated One Piece KAI (Subbed) to fill in missing episodes
- Alternate posters and background art for a richer UI

## Final Notes

This Addon mainly focuses on pre-time skip arcs once you get past "impel Down" there are no more gaps filled by One Piece KAI, you are better off switching to the original [OnePace addon](https://github.com/fedew04/OnePaceStremio) as this is being actively updated with the latest episodes as the one pace team release them.
